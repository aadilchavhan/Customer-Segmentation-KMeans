![Customer Segmentation Visualization](https://github.com/aadilchavhan/customer-segmentation-KMeans/blob/main/customer_segmentation_visual.png)  

## **Overview**  
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to analyze customer spending patterns from an **Indian retail sales dataset** sourced from Kaggle. By segmenting customers based on purchase behaviors, retailers can optimize **marketing strategies** and improve **customer engagement**.  

## **Dataset Information**  
- **Dataset Source:** [Retail Sales Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset)  
- The dataset consists of **1000 customer records** with key attributes:
  - **Transaction ID** – Unique identifier for transactions.  
  - **Date** – Date of the transaction.  
  - **Customer ID** – Unique identifier for customers.  
  - **Gender** – Male/Female classification.  
  - **Age** – Age of the customer.  
  - **Product Category** – Category of the purchased product.  
  - **Quantity** – Number of units purchased.  
  - **Price per Unit** – Cost per unit of the product.  
  - **Total Amount** – Total amount spent in the transaction.  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to apply **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **K-Means clustering** to uncover **customer segmentation trends** based on their **spending habits**. This segmentation will enable businesses to refine their **targeted marketing strategies** and enhance revenue generation.  

## **Tools & Libraries**  
This project utilizes the following technologies:  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for clustering implementation
